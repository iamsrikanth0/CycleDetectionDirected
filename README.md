# CycleDetectionDirected
Approach is different here, In our recursion stack, it the Node is already visited then we say that a cycle exits
So here instead of parent, we are using recursion stack and visited array way of tracking.
For recursion stack, we use array 
Seems vis and recursion array doing the same function. But note the direction is important here.
